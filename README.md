## readBrukerNMR -- Read Bruker NMR Data Sets.

Read in Bruker NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) data.  Currently only reads processed data.  Built around the Python [nmrglue](https://github.com/jjhelmus/nmrglue) package by JJ Helmus.

## How to install readBrukerNMR

<!-- ### From CRAN using R:

````r
chooseCRANmirror() # choose a CRAN mirror
install.packages("readBrukerNMR")
library("readBrukerNMR")
```` -->

### To install from Github using R:

````r
install.packages("remotes")
library("remotes")

If you use `@devel` you can get the development branch if it is available (and there may be other branches out there too).  Development branches have new, possibly incompletely tested features.  They may may also not be ready to pass checks and thus may not install automatically using the method above.  Check the news file to see what's up.
